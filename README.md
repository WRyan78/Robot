# Robot
small project for class

as I migrate code away from the learning sites I'm learning pretty quick there's a lot of stuff they're not mentioning. 
Like why the projects only work on their particular sites. 
This (crappy) robot being a great example. 

No wonder I keep coming back to FreeCodeCamp over the other sites.
